Project Description:
As part of my work, I undertook a project to update file permissions in the projects directory, ensuring the appropriate level of authorization and enhancing system security.

Tools:
- Linux command line interface (CLI)

Steps:
1. Checked existing permissions using "ls -la" command.
2. Used "chmod" command to modify file and directory permissions.
3. Removed write access for "other" on a specific file.
4. Adjusted permissions for a hidden file, granting read access to the group and removing write access for the user and group.
5. Restricted directory permissions to allow access only for the researcher2 user.
