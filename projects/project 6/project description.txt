Project Description:
As a cybersecurity analyst, I conducted an incident response project to address a DDoS attack that disrupted all network services. The objective was to mitigate the attack, restore critical network resources, and implement preventive measures.

Tools:
- Firewall with rate limiting capabilities
- IDS/IPS system
- Network monitoring software

Steps:
1. Identified and mitigated a DDoS attack through an ICMP flood.
2. Implemented firewall rules and an IDS/IPS system to filter suspicious traffic.
3. Used network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns.
4. Isolated affected systems, restored critical services, and analyzed network logs.
5. Implemented preventive measures such as blocking external ICMP flood attacks and prioritizing service restoration during recovery.
