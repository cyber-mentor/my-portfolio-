Steps:
1. Conducted a security risk assessment.
2. Selected three hardening methods: MFA, strong password policies, and regular firewall maintenance.
3. Recommended MFA for preventing unauthorized access.
4. Proposed strong password policies for increased security.
5. Advised regular firewall maintenance for ongoing protection.
